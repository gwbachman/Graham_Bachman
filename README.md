# [Kaggle - Freesound, General Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://github.com/gwbachman/Freesound-General-Purpose-Audio-Tagging/tree/main)
![](/Images/spectrogram_1.png)
* Problem: Build a general-purpose audio tagging system capable of classifying a diverse range of real-world sounds.
* Solution: Transform the provided dataset of WAV files into waveform images. Transform the waveform images into spectrogram images. Train several CNN's on the spectrogram image dataset. 
* Tools Used: AWS, Python (packages include: keras, tensorflow, librosa, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy)


# [Spotify - Musical Taste Dashboard](https://github.com/gwbachman/spotify_listening_profile)
![](/Images/spotify_taste.png)
* Problem: How can Spotify listeners be profiled to enable smarter and surprising music recommendations that span genres and decades.
* Solution: Leveraged the Spotify API to create dataset showing several technical metrics for my most listened to songs by year. Brought that dataset into Tableau and developed a visualization to explore my created dataset.
* Tools Used: Tableau, Python (spotipy package was particularly useful)


# [Machine Learning - Predicting AirBnb Prices w/ Neural Nets](https://github.com/gwbachman/Graham_Portfolio/edit/main/README.md)
![](/Images/airbnb-logo.jpg)
* Problem: At the time of this project, AirBnb had no tools in place to help owners optimally price their properties (excpet by observing how other nearby properties were priced). Myself and a few other undergraduate students undertook to develop a neural network that could reliably predict the price of a given AirBnB property based on its amentities, location, and other factors. The goal was a proof of concept in how AirBnb could employ machine learning to standardize property pricings across their platform.
* Solution: 
* Tools Used: Python (packages include: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, keras, tensorflow)
